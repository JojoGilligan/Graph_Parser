This is a simple graph parser. It takes in a cooked graph file for ProPPR and parses out the graphs (represented by a line on each file), and puts it in exports/_Name of cooked file_\_n.baked

The output format of this graph is in the format that is taken by the graph ProPPR graph visualizer.

Where n = line number.


Run the parser by the following command: 

    python graph\_parser.py textfile.cooked
